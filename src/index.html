          “Concentrate every minute like a Roman— like a man— on doing what’s in
          front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly,
          willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other
          distractions. Yes, you can— if you do everything as if it were the
          last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop
          letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being
          hypocritical, self-centered , irritable. You see how few things you
          have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage
          this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.”
